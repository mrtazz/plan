# DESCRIPTION

`plan` is a command line utility to help with personal planning and note
taking. The premise is that notes are plain text files (assumed to be in
markdown format) in a folder. The tooling can then generate a daily note based
on a configured (or default) template. The main interaction for notes is
intended to be your favourite editor while `plan` provides tooling around it.

# CONFIGURATION FILE

`plan` reads a `.plan.yaml` configuration file in the current directory. That
way the config file can be colocated in the notes directory and different
settings can be used for different notes directories.

An example configuration file in yaml format can look like this

```
recurring_tasks:
  Monday:
    - plan the week

  Friday:
    - update achievements doc

daily_template: |-
  ## Misc

  It's {{ .Weekday }} today.
  You have {{ len .RecurringTasks }} recurring tasks today:
  {{ range .RecurringTasks }}
  - [ ] {{- .Name }}
  {{- end }}

  You have {{ len .AssignedTasks }} issues assigned:
  {{- range .AssignedTasks }}
  - [ ] {{ .Name }} [link]({{ .URL }})
  {{- end }}

  ## Log

date_format: "2006-01-02"

github:
  task_query: "assignee:mrtazz org:github state:open"

screenshot_import:
  source: "~/Desktop"
  destination: "dailies/20060102_attachments"
  file_format: "Screenshot 2006-01-02 at 15.04.05.png"
```

Validity of a configuration file can be checked with the `validate-config`
subcommand.

## RECURRING TASKS

`plan` supports simple weekly recurring tasks which can be added to the
configuration file. This is an array of strings that are available in the
template via the `{{ .RecurringTasks }}` templating macro.

`plan` also provides assigned tasks via the `{{ .AssignedTasks }}` macro in
the same way. Tasks here are taken from GitHub and have a `{{  .Name }}` and
`{{ .URL }}` attribute available for template rendering. In order for this to
work, a task query in GitHub search format needs to be configured.

## NOTE TEMPLATE RENDERING

The daily note is rendered with a small set of context variables that can be
used in templating. The templating engine is Go's `text/template` and should
be expected to behave in the same way:

- `{{ .Weekday }}`: Prints the current day of the week
- `{{ .FormattedDate }}`: Prints the current date formatted based on the
  `date_format` config key (default: "2006-01-02")
- `{[ .RecurringTasks }}`: An array of recurring tasks for the day as set in the
  configuration file. Can be iterated over and accessed with `{{ .Name }}`
  within
- `{{ .AssignedTasks }}`: An array of assigned issues from GitHub, based on
  the configured `github.task_query`. Can be iterated over and accessed with
  `{{ .Name }}` and `{{ .URL }}`

# IMPORTING SCREENSHOTS

The `plan` subcommand `import-screenshots` provides a way to consolidate
screenshots in the plan folder for easier referencing in notes. On running the
command it will list all screenshots (this technically works with any file and
not just images) in the source directory that match the provided file format.
If the command is run with the `--no-dry-run` flag provided, the files will be
moved to the destination directory.

Both the file format as well as the destination directory can contain golang
time format directives which will be interpreted as such. That makes it
possible to extract dates from screenshots and file them in date base folders.
The config file section that is used for configuration is `screenshot_import`
and the section `CONFIGURATION FILE` above has an example.
